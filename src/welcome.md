# Welcome 

This Community-Maintained book is a central place for Rocket Pool Node Operators, Liquid Stakers, and enthusiasts to discover tools and resources.

It isn't a replacement for the [official docs](https://docs.rocketpool.net/).
Instead of high-level overviews or step-by-step guides, it aims to highlight useful websites and tools, many of which are built by the community.
